# The project
This project utilizes Pokemon API service (https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html/) to print out Pokemon species and some information about them.

The code uses Vanilla JS, thus no need for setup :)

## Features 
1) Fetch through pagination different Pokemon species.
2) Allow filtering *displayed* pokemons by name of species.
3) Display default photo of pokemon.js species and display alternatives.
